<h2>MEMOIR.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapi"><span class="dropcap">I</span></span>T has been a sad but not entirely
unpleasant duty to prepare, at the
request of the Maryland Historical
Society, a brief memoir of one of
our earliest and most distinguished
Honorary Members, the late <span class="smcap">Jared
Sparks, LL.D.</span> The duty, though
sad, is not without a pleasant recompense,
for the eulogium which a long-continued
friendship and intercourse demand can be
bestowed with cordial truth.</p>

<p>Mr. Sparks was what we call, in America, a self-made
man. Although his life is a fair illustration of
what an industrious person of talent and common
sense may compass by decision of character and a
high aim, my object in these observations is not to
draw from his biography what has been aptly called
"ostentatious precepts and impertinent lessons."
By a self-made man I do not mean to class Mr.
Sparks with that large and influential body of citizens
whose portraits adorn the illustrated newspapers,
and whose memoirs disclose the opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
that the making of a great deal of money is the
making of a very exemplary man. When I speak
of Mr. Sparks as a self-made man I use the phrase
in a sense of intellectual progress and success,
founded on self-relying discipline,&mdash;of mental culture
and mental fruit, bringing him up to honorable
fame from low obscurity,&mdash;making him a
lasting power in our nation, nay, throughout the
world, in our best society, in our literature, in our
institutions of learning; and, finally, bestowing on
him the just pecuniary rewards always due, yet
seldom obtained in America, by intellectual pursuits
alone.</p>

<p>Jared Sparks, the son of Joseph and Eleanor
Orcutt Sparks, was born in Willington, Connecticut,
on the 10th of May, 1789. The dawn of
his life was overshadowed by poverty. I do not
know the character or pursuits of his parents, but
certainly they were very poor; nor have I found
any record of their early care over the child, or,
that his youth was comforted by the love and society
of a brother or sister. The most reliable account
I have received of his infancy shows that he went,
with the childless sister of his mother, and her wayward
husband, to Washington county, New York,
and that the eager boy obtained the scant elements
of education at the public schools of those days;
working, at the same time, on a farm for his livelihood,
and sometimes serving a dilapidated saw-mill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
(his uncle's last resource,) whose slow movements
afforded him broken hours to pour over a copy of
Guthrie's Geography, which he always spoke of as
a "real treasure."</p>

<p>Thus, there were no external influences to bring
forth whatever powers were inborn in his character.
Probably, it was in spite of those influences that he
became a man of mark. His aunt, kind at all
times, is chiefly remembered for her gentleness and
beauty; his mother, for her devotion to reading,
and mainly to the constant study of Josephus;
while the grandmother of these ladies, Bethiah
Parker, is mentioned as a singular enthusiast, who
left to her posterity a manuscript volume of poems
and letters peculiar only from the fact that, while
they are vehicles of religious fervor, they are also
autobiographical sketches, in which she discloses (in
1757) her prophetic visions of the "terrible times
that are to come among the nations." There may
have been some inheritance by the youth from his
mother of a fondness for books, for he always
spoke of her with great respect as a superior
woman; but the probability is that the intellectual
turn of his mind originated within itself, and
was cherished by the affection he felt, and everywhere
inspired as a boy, and the personal interest
with which such a disposition is always repaid.
His impressible mind was, doubtless, affected by
the grand or beautiful scenery amid which his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
early life was passed. He was a bright pupil of
all his teachers. One of them he so soon excelled
in acquirements that the honest pedagogue frankly
advised him to seek an abler instructor. But that
boon was not to be at once or easily obtained, for
Jared was too poor to follow the master's advice;
and, becoming apprenticed to a carpenter, he
wrought at his trade for two years, still employing
his spare time in study. He borrowed and
mastered a common sailor's book on navigation.
He taught himself the names and positions of
the stars, and how to calculate the simpler problems
of astronomy, the higher mysteries of which
he also strove to unravel. For this purpose, he
bought a large wooden ball, on which he marked
the stars and traced the course of a celebrated
comet; and finally he succeeded in calculating an
eclipse. At sixteen, he seems to have lost entirely
the care of his aunt and uncle, so that he was
adrift in the world from that early period. But,
his gentle and intellectual character had made
him friends. His conduct was observed in that
New England neighborhood, where such indications
of worth are not only praised but protected.
His employer, seeing the tendency of his mind and
appreciating his talent, voluntarily released him
from indenture, and his first impulse upon emancipation
was to become, himself, a schoolmaster.
He applied, at once, to the local authorities. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
school-committee examined and passed him; and
being thus pronounced able to instruct, he taught
in a small district on the outskirts of Tolland, until
the scholars ceased coming during the summer,
when Jared, for lack of means, was obliged to
return for support to his saw and chisel.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, he was not detained long
at the work-bench. The story of a carpenter-boy
studying Euclid and solving algebraic problems,
made a stir in the village of Willington, where he
then lived. Nor could the eager youth any longer
study alone. Sparks became restless under the
double goad of his ambition and his disadvantages,
and plucking up courage, one day marched
bravely into the presence of the Rev. Hubbell
Loomis, an intelligent and cultivated clergyman,
requesting his counsel and instruction. Mr. Loomis
examined him carefully, and, taking him as an
inmate of his house, taught him mathematics gratuitously,
and induced him to commence the study of
Greek and Latin, encouraging the spirit of independence&mdash;which
was very lively in Sparks&mdash;by
allowing him to shingle his barn as partial compensation
for board and tuition.</p>

<p>Hitherto, the life of a schoolmaster had been his
utmost ambition, and the trials he made satisfied
him that, with his love of knowledge and desire to
impart it, he would ultimately be able to succeed.
The prospect of a college course had not yet dawned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
on him. But, from his patron Loomis to others of
greater influence the carpenter's merit spread wider
and wider, until the Rev. Abiel Abbott, then a
clergyman at Coventry, Connecticut, procured for
him a scholarship at Phillips Exeter Academy,
upon a benevolent foundation, to which meritorious
pupils of limited means were admitted without
charge for board and instruction. On the 4th of
September, 1809, he left Tolland, Connecticut, and
<i>walked</i> the one hundred and twenty miles to Exeter,
New Hampshire, becoming a scholar of the Academy
for two years. Here he first met, as fellow
pupils, his life-long friends, Palfrey and Bancroft.
He studied diligently, and made rapid progress;
yet, anxious to preserve his independence, and to
obtain what was necessary for his personal comfort
without further tax on friends or obligation
to strangers, he taught, during one winter of these
two years, a school at Rochester in New Hampshire.
In one of his memorandums he sums up
his tuition thus: "the whole amount of my schooling
was about forty months, which was the length
of time I attended school before I was <i>twenty</i> years
old."</p>

<p>But the great hope of his heart&mdash;a hope that had
been gradually kindled&mdash;was at last to be realized,
and, in 1811, at the age of twenty-two, through the
active interest of President Kirkland, Sparks
entered Harvard University, on a Pennoyer scholarship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Yet, the <i>res angusta domi</i> pursued him still.
It is said, that, "in consequence partly of ill health
and partly of poverty," he was unable to pass more
than two entire years, of his four, at Cambridge. To
eke out a slender but necessary income, he obtained
leave of absence during parts of his Freshman and
Sophomore years, and spent the time as a private
teacher in the family of Mr. Mark Pringle, at Havre
de Grace, Maryland. He was there when the
British, under Admiral Cockburn, plundered and
partly destroyed the village; and here, probably,
he enjoyed the only military experience of his life,
by serving, as a private, in the Maryland militia,
called out to guard the neighborhood. The inhabitants,
it is related, generally fled to the woods,
and but few, among whom was Sparks, remained
to witness the barbarous behaviour of the enemy.
Fifteen months of this leave of absence were, thus,
spent in our State, in the bosom of an excellent and
refined family, by whose members he was warmly
esteemed; and, at length, he received his degree of
Bachelor of Arts, at Harvard, with the class of
1815.</p>

<p>His college course, notwithstanding its interruptions,
was successful. President Kirkland used to
say, in his quaint way, "Sparks is not only a man,
but a man and a-half." He graduated with high
honors. In his senior year he gained the Bowdoin
prize for an essay on the physical discoveries of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Sir Isaac Newton, an essay which is remembered
in the traditions of the University as "a masterpiece
of analytic exposition, philosophical method,
lucid and exact statement."</p>

<p>This successful essay was, perhaps, the key of his
life and character, for his mind was emphatically
clear, exact, analytic, mathematical; and throughout
his career, the same qualities were distinct in
whatever he investigated or wrote. It has, indeed,
been said that his merits were already recognized
by the rival University of Yale, and that offers for
his removal thither had been made during one
of his years at Harvard; but the friendly influence
of Dr. Kirkland prevailed over those allurements,
and he remained constant to his patron and
college.</p>

<p>The years 1816 and 1817 were passed by the
graduate in teaching a private school at Lancaster,
Massachusetts. He finished his college course
at the advanced age of twenty-six, and had now
added two years more to the score. At Lancaster
he cultivated those habits of methodical industry
which always characterized him afterwards. Soon
after undertaking the school, he wrote: "I board
at Major Carter's, a mile and a quarter from my
school, to and from which I walk twice a day.
I rose this morning an hour before sunrise, and
rode five or six miles before breakfast, an exercise
which I shall continue regularly. My school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
occupies six hours, and I have resolved to devote,
and thus far, have devoted, six hours of the
twenty-four to study." Before this, he has a
memorandum of walking from Cambridge to Bolton,
twenty-six miles; setting out at half-past
one, and arriving at Bolton at eight in the
evening.</p>

<p>In 1817, at the age of twenty-eight, and two
years after graduation, his <i>alma mater</i> recognizing
the tendency of his mind towards the exact
sciences, as well as the extent of his acquirements,
chose him tutor in Mathematics and Natural
Philosophy at Harvard. There also, very soon
afterwards, chiefly under the instruction of the
Rev. Dr. Ware, who was then the Hollis Professor,
he commenced the study of divinity, pursuing
it zealously during two years, being, at the
same time, the "working editor" of the North
American Review. Its numbers from May, 1817,
to March, 1819, inclusive, were edited by him.
In May, of the latter year, at the age of thirty,
he was called to Baltimore and ordained in this
city as the first pastor of the Unitarian church
which had just been erected. On this memorable
occasion, the Rev. Dr. William Ellery Channing
preached that discourse in exposition of the Unitarian
faith, which has been so widely celebrated,
published, and read in America and Europe: a
discourse which is said to have "caused more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
remark on its theological views, while more controversy
grew out of the statement of doctrines
therein declared, than any single religious discourse
in this country ever occasioned."</p>

<p>As clergyman of this congregation, Mr. Sparks
remained a resident of our city for four years.
He is well remembered in the families of his own
church and of other religious societies, among
whose members his firm but genial manners
always made the studious and estimable gentleman
a welcome guest. He was a steadfast
laborer among his congregation; but the ultimate
literary drift of his life was already beginning
to develop itself, having probably received
an impetus from his editorial task on the North
American Review. In addition to his clerical
duty in Baltimore, he did a great deal of work in
editing the Unitarian Miscellany, in publishing
his well-known Letters on the Comparative Moral
tendency of the Unitarian and Trinitarian Doctrines,
which drew on him the controversial notice
of that renowned champion, Dr. Miller, of Princeton,
and produced a discussion, which, instead of
estranging the combatants, strengthened their personal
relations, and increased their mutual confidence
and respect. In after years, when Mr.
Sparks required a Life of Jonathan Edwards for
his American Biography, he selected Dr. Miller
to write it, and, in the truly liberal spirit that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
always governed his editorial labors, and, indeed,
his whole literary life, published the memoir of
the great Calvanist "without the alteration of a
single word." It was here, too, in Baltimore, in
consequence of a sermon against Unitarianism by
the late Rev. Dr. Wm. E. Wyatt, of St. Paul's,
that Mr. Sparks published his volume of Letters
on the Ministry, Ritual, and Doctrines of the Protestant
Episcopal Church. It was in Baltimore,
in 1822, that he arranged and began the republication
of Essays and Tracts in Theology by
Wm. Penn, Bishop Hoadley, Newton, Whitby,
Evelyn, Locke, and others. It was in Baltimore,
also, during his religious ministry, that he
received the flattering tribute from Congress of
being elected its Chaplain. This was a great
honor, won in ten years, by the Harvard student
of 1811; and although his election alarmed the
clergy and laity of other Christian denominations,
and a member of Congress declared they had
"voted Christ out of the House," still, in time,
Congress learned to know him better, to admit
the tolerance of his catholic spirit, and to honor
him with increased confidence. But, in 1823,
after four years of labor in our city, Mr. Sparks's
health became so much impaired that he resolved
to retire from the Church entirely, and devote
himself exclusively to literature. Yet, he always
loved Baltimore; he always met the people with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
warmth, and recurred joyfully to the happy years
he spent in Maryland as teacher and minister.
At the beginning of the late rebellion he wrote to
me concerning an address published by one of our
patriotic citizens: "I could not," said he, "but
approve most highly its candor and independent
tone, and the enlightened and just views it presented
of our public affairs. It furnished a demonstration
that there were brave spirits and true
in your city, notwithstanding the misgivings which
many, in this quarter, had, at that time, begun to
indulge. Most heartily do I wish prosperity, good
fortune, and success to Baltimore. With no place
have I more deeply cherished associations. May
peace, quiet, and brotherly sympathies prevail
within her borders." And again, at a later day,
he wrote in the same strain of affectionate memory
of our city and its people: "I take a lively
interest in all that concerns Maryland both present
and past. I have not forgotten that my home was
once there. I have many and deeply cherished
recollections of Baltimore, which will remain in
my heart and mind while the power of memory
continues to act. The order of Providence and
strange events have produced changes, <i>but it is
Baltimore, still</i>." Such were the sentiments of this
excellent man towards our state, and city, and
people. They continued to be cherished by him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
to the last hour of his life, and were warmly
repeated to me in one of the last letters he ever
wrote, received but a day or two before his death.
He left Baltimore reluctantly; his congregation
parted with him painfully, and its farewell letter,
written and signed by the late Chancellor of our
state, Theodorick Bland, bears the most honorable
testimony to the success of his pastoral
labors.</p>

<p>Yet, probably, it was not ill health alone that
determined Mr. Sparks's removal to Boston. I
think he had already set his heart on the great
themes of National History, and resolved, if possible,
to pursue the work faithfully by the acquisition
of the vast and scattered materials it needed.
Upon his arrival in Massachusetts in 1823, he purchased
the North American Review, and became
its sole editor from January, 1824, to April, 1830.
In these seven years his industrious pen contributed
no less than fifty articles, many of profound
study, and all adding to the solid critical literature
of America. It was in 1828 that he made his
first elaborate biographical essay in the attractive
Life of John Ledyard, the American Traveller.
About this time, too, good fruits were borne to
him by his previous residence in Baltimore and
the acquaintance he had made with the illustrious
men who, in those days, were found every winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
in Washington. In that city his worth had been
recognized by the descendants of prominent revolutionary
personages, by leading legislators and
public functionaries from the several States, and,
particularly, by such persons as Chief Justice
Marshall, the biographer of Washington, and his
nephew Bushrod Washington and Mr. Justice
Story, both, at that time, Associate Judges of the
Supreme Court. Thenceforward, the idea that had
taken possession of his mind on the temporary failure
of his health at Baltimore&mdash;"the city of noble
souls, of large-hearted men," as he was wont to
call it&mdash;became the ruling purpose of his life. He
was to run the career of a man of letters, and in a
country hardly ripe for literary production. American
history was to be his occupation; all things
else became subservient to this great purpose. He
had conceived the project of collecting the correspondence
of Washington, and of gathering all the
accessible documents in this country and Europe
necessary for an authentic life of the great chief.
On his first application for the Washington manuscripts,
which Mr. Justice Bushrod Washington had
intended to edit, Mr. Sparks was told, much as he
was respected, he could by no means have them.
Yet, his journal of that date has no complaining,
despondent mention of the rebuff, for, on that very
day he set forth from the city of Washington on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
his journey to the South, in quest of other materials;
and, with a light, confident, indefatigable
spirit, went on patiently collecting them from
public and private sources, everywhere finding
profitable work, and, with marvellous keenness
and sagacity, choosing and appropriating whatever
he should want for the great task which it
was his destiny to accomplish. Our archives at
Annapolis, scant and neglected as they unfortunately
are, still bear marks of his diligence; and,
years after his task was completed in our State
House, I have found, among our documents, the
frequent traces of his minute and accurate labors.
This, I am told, was a life-long trait of his preparation,
for he always provided himself with every
species of preliminary information which could
lead to what he did not possess, in case, at some
future day, it might become useful or necessary.
His memorandums, therefore, were copious and
explicit. Indeed, he became so familiar with the
archives of the several States, that from his study
in Massachusetts, he could readily, without a
fresh journey, command the desired documents,
and always indicate the department, and, generally,
the shelf, book, or bundle in which the
coveted manuscript was to be found by his correspondents.
And, so he went on cheerily from
state to state and family to family, increasing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
national treasures, until, at last, the richest of the
American collections was yielded to him by the
Washington family and the government. The
manuscripts at Mount Vernon&mdash;the entire correspondence
of Washington and his papers&mdash;arranged
by him in more than two hundred folio
volumes; the state papers of the "old thirteen,"
and the private papers of many of the civil and
military leaders of the Revolution, were opened
to his inspection, and some of them actually placed
in his possession for ten years, while engaged in
the composition of his great work.</p>

<p>This would have been anxious labor even for a
man of leisure, robust health, and a fortune that
secured him from all care for present support or
comfort. But Sparks was still poor, and, while
engaged in this expensive preliminary task of
mere accumulation&mdash;a task that might produce
profitable results after many years&mdash;he was also
obliged to provide for the needs of the passing
day. His ready talent and economical habits
enabled him to do it.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Nor did he rest satisfied
with what he found in the United States or could
gain by correspondence from abroad. He went to
Europe to complete his researches; and the national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
and private archives of France and England,
which had hitherto been closed to American students,
were soon unlocked for him through the
personal solicitations in his favor of Sir James
Mackintosh, Mr. Lockhart, Mr. Hamilton, Lord
Landsdowne, and Lord Holland, in Great Britain,
and of General Lafayette, Monsieur Guizot, and
Monsieur de Marbois in France;&mdash;another proud
achievement by the charity student of 1811. I may
add here, at once, that Mr. Sparks paid a second
visit to Europe in 1840, in order to examine its
archives; on that occasion, discovering, in the
French cabinet, the original letter of Franklin and
the famous map with our North-eastern boundary
delineated by a "red line," which were so much
discussed in the subsequent negotiations with Great
Britain in regard to our limits in that quarter.</p>

<p>The first fruits of these domestic and foreign
studies was Mr. Sparks's valuable publication, in
1829-30, of the Diplomatic Correspondence of the
Revolution; followed, after two years, by the Life
of Gouverneur Morris, with selections from his correspondence
and miscellaneous papers. In 1830,
he originated and edited that excellent annual, so
long a favorite in our country, known as the
American Almanac; and, about the same time, he
began his Library of American Biography, extending,
in two series, to twenty-five volumes, for which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
he composed the charming biographies of La Salle,
Ribault, Pulaski, Benedict Arnold, Father Marquette,
Charles Lee, and Ethan Allen.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his attention to the great work&mdash;the
Life and Writings of Washington&mdash;never
flagged. Of course, the labor of careful selection,
arrangement, and illustration was immense. His
apartment in Ashburton Place, Boston, was covered
from floor to ceiling with volumes and packages;
nor did he ever leave it until his completed
task of ten or twelve hours' work, freed him, after
night, for a healthful walk and a refreshing visit
to friends. Ten of these busy years were thus
spent in the preparation, printing, and publication
of the Life and Writings of Washington, which
was finally given to the world, volume by volume,
between 1834 and 1837, in twelve stout octavos,
at a cost, I understand, of about one hundred
thousand dollars. In 1840, appeared his other
great national book, the Life and Works of Franklin,
in ten massive octavos, comprizing, among
other valuable papers discovered by him, no less
than two hundred and fifty-three letters of the
philosopher, never before printed, and one hundred
and fifty-four not included in any previous
edition. To this superb collection he added the
"Life" as far as it had been written by Franklin
himself, and continued it, from his own materials,
to the patriot's death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>In seventeen years, and at the age of fifty-one,
he had won the highest honors of literature, and
the right to have his name linked forever, throughout
the world, with the names of Franklin and
Washington. Nor were these honors less dear to
him when he reflected that he had reached the
mature age of thirty-four before he had <i>a real purpose
in life</i>, and that, in spite of adverse fortune, he
had accomplished his designs by the force of character,
by self-denial and indomitable industry.</p>

<p>In 1852-3, occurred the singular controversy
between Lord Mahon, Mr. W. B. Reed, and Mr.
Sparks, in regard to the manner in which the latter
had edited Washington's Writings. It was
conducted by our late colleague with good temper
and success. He vindicated his facts and plan
from all assaults, foreign and domestic, and was,
doubtless, vastly aided by the exact method with
which his letters, documents, and references had
been arranged for his great work. For, <i>preparation</i>
was, at once, his task and his strength. He
always wrote rapidly and alone, without the aid of
an amanuensis, as soon as he was prepared to compose.
He then worked with great perfection and
ease to himself, because the materials were not
only at hand but thoroughly digested. When
asked how long a time would be required by him
to make an abridgement of his Life of Washington,
while he was still busy with his Franklin, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
reply was, "No time!" and the printer never
waited for him a moment, so keen and clear were
his decision and sense of proportion.</p>

<p>In 1854, he published the Correspondence of the
American Revolution, in letters from eminent
men to General Washington from the time of his
taking command of the army to the end of his
Presidency. This valuable addition to his historical
series was prepared from the original MSS.,
and terminated Mr. Sparks's important contributions
to our national stores. It has been said that
he contemplated a History of the Foreign Diplomacy
of the Revolution, and it is quite certain that
he intended to write a <span class="smcap">History of the Revolution</span>,
itself, preceding it, probably, by several volumes
on our Colonial history. As I heard Mr.
Irving once say that the biography of Washington
was not a task to his liking, for "he had no <i>private</i>
life" to give it the personal interest essential to
secure the reader's sympathy; so it may truly be
said, from the constant publicity of the Chief's
career, that his life, during most of it, was the life
of his country. Nevertheless, Mr. Sparks felt that
it was, in truth, biography and not history, and
he sought a more extended field, for which he considered
his powers to be, as doubtless they were,
entirely equal. His collection of materials for this
purpose was rich, completed, and bound in volumes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
but his noble intention was, unfortunately,
frustrated, and with it perished his most cherished
hope. He always regretted his inability to go on
with this work. All his other publications, valuable
as they were, in his estimation had been but
preparatory. In 1850 he broke his right arm,
which was already weakened by a neuralgic affection
contracted by long years of labor at the desk.
This, ever afterwards, made the use of a pen
extremely irksome. Under the weight of these
mixed evils of nervous malady and fractured
limb, his task was procrastinated; yet, his patient
hope was profound. The conflict between the
desire to achieve and the disability was so painful,
that the subject of his projected History became
a sacred one among all who were familiar
with him, and, even in his family, it was passed
over in silence. At times, he would look at these
accumulations of years in his library, with the
simple ejaculation, "sad, sad!" When others
alluded to them, he had some light reply: "you
are a younger man; do <i>you</i> work?" It was his
great grief that the mine of golden ore was at
hand, but that <i>he</i> could work no more. Yet, he
never ceased to be prepared, by adding constantly
to his materials; and, even in the last year of his
life, he exclaimed, at times, "<i>I think I may soon go
on!</i>" He never ceased to look forward to the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
when his infirmity would allow him to march once
more in pursuit of what had become the "Evangeline"
of his life, the only work worthy of his
mature powers:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Something there was in his life incomplete, imperfect, unfinished,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if a morning in June, with all its music and sunshine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suddenly paused in the sky, and fading slowly, descended<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the east again, from whence it late had arisen!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The rich collection he had amassed for this History
of the American Revolution, carefully arranged
and bound in volumes, was bequeathed
to his son, ultimately to pass to the Library of
Harvard University. I understand his heir has
already discharged the trust by depositing these
treasures in the institution where their collector
designed they should be permanently preserved.</p>

<p>Although the life of Mr. Sparks as an author
may be said to have terminated with his last original
publications, he, nevertheless, did not withhold
himself from an active interest in the cause of letters.
He had been appointed McLean Professor
of Ancient and Modern History at Cambridge, in
1839; and for the ten following years, in the midst
of other work, performed the duties of that chair,
until, on the resignation of President Edward Everett,
his <i>alma mater</i> bestowed her highest honor
by electing him President of Harvard. This was
the <i>finale</i> of a career of successful labor extending
through thirty-eight years. His Presidency was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
acceptable as well as popular; especially commanding
the confidence and affectionate respect of
the pupils. He was no martinet, but fostered the
manhood of the generation entrusted to his government.
A friend who was present in Cambridge,
and well acquainted with Mr. Sparks's
administration of the Presidency, tells me that
its peculiarity was the parental character of his
intercourse with the under-graduates. After the
stateliness of some of his predecessors, this bland
demeanor of the new President alarmed by its
supposed relaxation of a discipline which the over-nice
are accustomed to enforce by a stern preservation
of cold formality; yet, even the critics who
considered him a little slack, did not fail to see
that he won the love of all, while many a poor
fellow in disgrace felt quite inclined to bless a rod
which fell in such sweet mercy.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>
<p>For three years, the successor of Kirkland,
Quincy, and Everett held the responsible Presidency;
nor, in all that period of watchfulness, did
he ever forget or neglect the striving, indigent students,
who required a helping hand in the days of
their adversity. His works had made him independent
in fortune, so that, wherever assistance
was needed, his was an open but judicious hand.
"In the days of his prosperity," it is said by one
who knew him well, "he returned to his original
benefactors not only the money he had received
from them, but more than the interest." On resigning
the Presidency of Harvard he retired to
the property he owned in Cambridge, where, in
the enjoyment of society, of favorite studies, and
of a large correspondence and intercourse with
friends and distinguished strangers, he passed the
remaining years of a tranquil life, which ended,
after a short and painless malady, on the 14th of
March, 1866, in the seventy-seventh year of his
age. The summons to eternity was sudden; but
the faith and the life of the veteran sustained him
to the close. As he was consciously approaching
it, "I think," said he, feebly, "I shall not recover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
<i>but I am happy</i>." And when asked whether he was
rightly understood as saying he was "<i>happy</i>," his
answer was, "<i>certainly!</i>"</p>

<p>Mr. Sparks was twice married; first, in 1832, to
Frances Anne Allen, of Hyde Park, New York,
who died in 1835; and again, in 1839, to Mary C.
Silsbee, daughter of Nathaniel Silsbee, a wealthy
and honored merchant of Salem, for many years a
Senator of the United States from Massachusetts, as
colleague of Daniel Webster. Four children, a son
and three daughters, all the offspring of the second
marriage, survive, with their mother, to rejoice in
the memory of their illustrious father.</p>

<p>The amount of Mr. Sparks's literary labor and
its popular estimation, maybe judged from the fact
that more than six hundred thousand volumes of
his various publications have been published and
disposed of.</p>

<p>In personal appearance Mr. Sparks had a noble
presence, a firm, bold, massive head, which, as age
crept on, sometimes seemed careworn and impassive;
but never lost its intellectual power. His portraits
show that in his prime his face was remarkable
for dignified, manly beauty. His manners
were winning; and, though undemonstrative and
rather reticent among strangers, with friends, he
was always cheerful and hearty. He was never
dogmatic, patronizing or repulsive, by that self-assertion
into which superior men are too often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
petted by the subservient deference of society. He
had large social resources, but, withal, was modest
without being shy. His character was, indeed, a
perfect balance of charming qualities. Though
moderate in the announcement of opinions, and too
patriotic to degenerate into a partizan, he gave no
timid, lukewarm support to the nation in its hour
of trial. His knowledge of the world was ample;
but that excellent lore did not always save him from
the overreaching, so that, at one time, he lost much
of the hard-earned avails of his labors, and though
not impoverished, was uncomfortably straitened.
Yet, he loved to be trustful and serviceable; and,
what he knew, he gave cordially to friends, correspondents,
and respectful strangers who approached
him properly. He desired to stimulate the young
by truthful approbation, and, from his recognized
eminence, to bestow the "nutritious praise of veteran
talent." He was never spoken of lightly.
Large and active as was his mind, "his heart,"
unlike Fontenelle's, was not "made of his brains."
He was as pure, affectionate, and charitable a man
in all his relations, as he was eminent in the literature
he created and consecrated to his country.</p>

<p>An author's life is commonly a catalogue of his
works. The career of a scholar is generally uneventful,
seldom possessing those stirring traits
which give dramatic interest to public characters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
of less quiet pursuits. Mr. Sparks was not an
exception to this rule. His life is in his works;
for, as long as he could work <i>well</i> he was a worker
for his country.</p>

<p>The few and simple facts I have told of this
gentle student's struggles and success, show that
his labors were mostly in the field of History.
But, the field of History is large and sub-divided.
It comprehends Annals, Chronicles, Memoirs, Biography;
and these&mdash;the essence of the past&mdash;become
the elements from which an artist endowed
with disciplined judgment and combining imagination,
shapes the master-pieces which are properly
called by the generic name, History.</p>

<p>It has been usual to associate the name of Mr.
Sparks with those of Bancroft, Prescott, Motley,
and Irving; yet, the qualities of these writers, as
well as the tasks they set themselves, seem to me
quite different from those of our late associate.</p>

<p>If History may be properly defined, as I think
it should be&mdash;a narrative of national life, claiming
the utmost comprehension of fact, date, description,
biography, annals, and chronicle, woven together
with brilliant analysis and wholesome philosophy,&mdash;I
hope I may not be considered unjust in the
opinion that, as yet, our country has but one writer
who will be classed with Hume and Gibbon. This
is certainly no disparagement of others, for it is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
probably, the result of extent of aim rather than of
quality or power. No American, of acknowledged
superiority, has yet equalled George Bancroft in
the breadth of his theme, the extent of time and
place covered, the variety of character, circumstance,
and nationality concerned, the corresponding
research, the sparkling story, and the philosophic
analysis of his National History.</p>

<p>Prescott, the prince of scholars and gentlemen,
matchless in the department he chose, was rather
a biographer than a historian. He selected stirring
epochs and their prominent men, the pivots of certain
times, upon whom the affairs of two worlds
turned at critical periods,&mdash;the great warders who
stood at the portals of America and Europe in the
sixteenth century. Thus, Ferdinand and Isabella,
Cortez, Pizarro, Charles V., and Philip II., wonderfully
as they revive in the books of Prescott,
exquisite in accuracy, harmonious style, and enamelled
finish, are but beautiful cabinet-pictures of
the princes and heroes of the age. The Life of a
Nation requires a taller and wider canvas, a bolder
and broader brush. And, so it is with the historical
labors of Irving and Motley, though the latter
has closely approached the true grandeur of History
in his narrative of the Rise of the Dutch
Republic. Yet, it must ever remain as the highest
praise of our late colleague, that, in the field of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
national <i>biographies</i>, national in all their elements,
he stands beside the masters on the platform of acknowledged
success. He was the real pioneer in
the unexplored wilderness of our historical literature.
"Indeed," says one familiar with his works,
"it requires considerable knowledge on the part of
a reader, <i>a knowledge of the state of things, of the obstacles
and perplexities, in the way of effort, and of the
hard conditions of success, at the time when Mr. Sparks
gave himself to his large and costly enterprise</i>, in order
that his eminent devotion and success may be, even
in degree, appreciated." But he brought together
the dispersed fragments of colonial and revolutionary
days, and made the writing of history untroublesome
for authors who, in "slippered ease"
and comfortable libraries, availed themselves of his
labor, and patronizingly patted him on the head.
These are the silk-worms of literature, whose glory
is spun from the digested leaves of other men's
culture. It was his habit, when allusions were
made to such appropriations, to find sufficient
reward in his own diligence, and to comfort himself
for this "way of the world" by a patient shrug
and a pinch of snuff.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Irving, in his advanced life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
could never have written his Washington, had not
Sparks organized his twelve volumes of materials,
and analysed them in the biography. That work
must be <i>studied</i>, in order to be appreciated in relation
to Mr. Sparks's literary merit: it is a mine of
editorial tact and industry, displaying the mathematical
spirit of the author in its method and
organization, in its lucid statements, and in his
sagacious perception of the value of what was
retained and the worthlessness of what was rejected,
so that Washington is self-shown to the
hereafter by what he thought, and wrote, and did.
The commendation bestowed on Mr. Sparks, in
the masterly eulogium of Mr. Haven before the
American Antiquarian Society, may be taken as
a wise and exact definition of his labors in the
field of History: "Not that Mr. Sparks," said he,
"limited himself to the preparation and preservation
of history <i>in bulk</i>; for he was equally able
in narrative, in criticism, and in controversy,&mdash;he
was an essayist as well as a compiler; but
the last was his <i>forte</i>, his peculiar field of usefulness
and eminence, where, it may be said, he
reigns supreme."</p>

<p>This estimate of Mr. Sparks by his friend does
not classify him with the annalist and chronicler
who build up a fleshless skeleton of facts and dates.
Nothing could be less just to the subject or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
commentator. Imagination was not a predominant
quality of Mr. Sparks's mind. Its cool precision
so curbed the exercise of the ideal faculty
that it was unjustly subdued if not absolutely
stifled; and thus we do not always discern in him
that creative power, so rarely found combined with
sagacity in gathering and marshalling details,
which, while it apprehends the true relation of
men and circumstances, masses the historic groups
with picturesque effect, delineates character with
intuitive insight, gives soul to the moving drama
of national life, and vividly <i>realizes</i> the scenes
and personages of the past. But, if he was not
so brilliant in description as others, or in the
majestic and harmonious march of his story, or
in keen scrutiny of character, he unquestionably
excelled in ample, direct, and truthful statement,
so that his narrative was not only transparent in
the fulness of detail, but the detail itself disclosed
its philosophic lesson. No man can charge him
with hasty or capricious censure. He was always
the careful protector of human reputation, dealing
with the unresisting and undefending dead as their
advocate as well as righteous judge; reluctant to
condemn by argument or inference, and never
unless the proved facts were irresistible. He studiously
discarded all that might either attract or
detract by fancy or elaborate discussion; in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
word, he shunned ambitious rhetoric, so perilous
to solid judgments, and so often giving false color
to historical portraits, for he knew the risk of
losing the reliable in the brilliant. In his style,
he was an artless artist, if there is truth in Thackeray's
observation, that the "true artist makes you
think of a great deal more than the objects before
you." His extreme calmness may have, sometimes,
made him cold; yet, by conforming himself
to plain forms of language, he always aimed
to convey the absolute truth, which he regarded
as the coveted prize of history. For history, to
his mind, was a serious thing, not a melodramatic
tale, and he wrote it as he would have delivered
testimony in the presence of God. His desire was
that the fact and not the form should fascinate and
teach; because the fact was permanent and independent,
the form flexible and voluntary. No one
knew better or more dreaded the risk of biasing
opinion by over or under-statements concerning
the conspicuous persons of whom he wrote. If his
theme was not so large as Mr. Bancroft's, he still
felt that both addressed the American nation in
words that were to last, concerning the founders of
our political system and the Chief who presided at
the foundation. What he recorded was to form
the opinions of posterity, and thus, not merely to
influence but virtually to become a principle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
action for his countrymen in relation to the great
things that concern patriots. Enthusiastic, yet,
never excited; patient, and devoid of partizanship;
he had the rare faculty of writing so fairly of men
of a near period that his books were satisfactory to
every one, save Lord Mahon. He never wrote a
sentence that was not in the interest of his whole
country. He was so calmly judicial in temper,
that he found it easy to convert himself into what
Madame de Stael so happily called "contemporaneous
posterity."</p>

<p>His life demonstrates that cultivated talents,
independent self-respect, and industry in intellectual
pursuits, not only secure reputation but
fortune. It is a plea for wholesome literature in
our land. Literature, though never a speculation
in his hands, was, as he conducted it, a successful
enterprise. His career was charmingly rounded
by honor, prosperity, and the love of mankind.
In all respects it was a requited life. Be it said,
with reverence, that, considering the difference of
their fields, there is a singular concord between
the virtues and common sense of Washington and
Sparks, and hence the sympathetic veneration of
the Author for the Hero. If I attempted to characterize
him briefly, I might say that he attained
all the ends of an ambitious life without being, at
any time, ambitious. He was certainly not devoid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
of a love of approbation, but it was not the selfish
end for which he wrought; for, with him, approbation
bestowed was only a recognition of the fact
that his endeavor to be a good and useful man
had been successful.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The Rev. James Freeman Clark relates a characteristic anecdote of Dr. Sparks's
demeanor to the Harvard scholars, which is worthy of repetition: One of the pupils,
as he left the recitation-room, made a noise derisive of a tutor. The tutor stated the
fact to the faculty, with the names of several, who, if not guilty, might know the real
offender. They were summoned before the faculty, and President Sparks was desired
to ask them, one by one, "if they made the noise, or, knew who made it?" Dr. Sparks
had previously said to the faculty that they could not expect to get the information
thus, or suppose the boys would inform on their fellows; the invitation to falsehood
was too great. When they came before him, Dr. S. addressed them to the following
effect: "I have been requested by the faculty to ask you if you made, or, know who
made, the disturbance at the close of your recitation. I state to you their request;
but, if you know who made the noise, I do not intend to ask you to tell." The answers
were various; till, at length, one said: "I did it. I know I ought not to have done it,
and am sorry. I hardly know why I did it; yes, I should say it was because I did
not like the tutor, who, I thought, had not used me fairly in some of my recitations."
Having told the truth, and acknowledged his fault, Dr. Sparks thought the youth
should be commended instead of punished; but the tutors outvoted the others, and
he was suspended. The President, however, wrote a note to his father, saying he
considered it no dishonor, as young men did not often have such opportunities to
show themselves frank and noble. (<i>Memoir of Sparks</i>, <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, vol. x., p. 153.)</p></div>
